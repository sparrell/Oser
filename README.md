# Oser

The Ogres Sbom Examples Repo (OSER)
will contain example SBOMs, VEXs, NVD CVE's, and other "posture attributes"
needed to evaluate/test Ogres and other PACE systems.
Besides being an acronym, Oser is derived from "ose" and "oser".
Ose is the Latin suffix meaning "full of", "abounding in", "given to", or "like".
So in this context, this repo is "abounding in" example data.
Oser means "to dare", as in "Do we dare to start populating this data?" :-)

Editor's note: organize sboms by type, state, source, usecase, ....

Editor's note: actually add sboms to repo not just links

Editor's note: include "bad" sboms as well
- broken serializations (xml, json)
- good serializations but bad sbom semantic checks
   + fails spdx or cdx validation
- missing primary

Editor's note: include source, build, executable-analysis SBOMs

Editor's note: include spdx, cdx, swid SBOMs

Editor's note: include all the serialization variants

Editor's note: include CSAF VEXs

Editor's note: include cdx VEXs

Editor's note: include different versions of same SBOM (ie updated SBOM)

Editor's note: include new version of "product" (ie new SBOM for new version)

Editor's note: include SBOMs referenced from MUD (mudmaker.org?)
